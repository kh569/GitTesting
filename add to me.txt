CS background is preferred, but it's more important that you are passionate about design, usability and other things non-code-related: you are good with code, but do it to *make things* and *make them cooler* - not to stare at ones and zeroes.
You code for fun and have a side project or two you help out with.


If you are a developer who thrives in a fast-paced environment and wants to work on high-visibility, high-impact projects, then come help us explore the multitude of opportunities available to our business.

Highly adaptable.
